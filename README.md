# percepolis-redux
React + Redux Implementation of Percepol.is Front-End

The purpose of this repository is to create a front-end application (back-end seperate), including login / register functionality, to submit entities and later rate + review them.

Appearance will be somewhat similar to larang-rebuild and percepolis-react-flux, but implementation will use React + Redux instead of React + Flux or Angular. The eventual goal will be to also develop a mobile app using React Native (but that is a ways off).

If, for whatever reason, you'd like to deploy locally you will just do the following:  

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/kylanhurt/percepolis-redux.git
$ npm install
$ npm start
